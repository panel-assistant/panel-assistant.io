title: Echo Show 5 Gen 2 (LineageOS)
description: Evidence notes for the community profile covering one contributor's Amazon Echo Show 5 Gen 2 reflashed with LineageOS 18.1.
---

:::caution
This is an import-only community profile based on one contributor's diagnostic report in GitHub [#28](https://github.com/maxlyth/ha-paneld/issues/28). It describes that user's LineageOS 18.1 reflash, not the retail device as sold. Stock Fire OS cannot run ha-paneld, and this profile is not bundled, automatically selected or validated by the project.
:::

The reported 2021 device is a 5.5-inch smart display whose reflash identifies the hardware with device codename `cronos` and model `Amzn Echo Show 5 (2nd Generation)`. The community profile requires both observed values in the same match group; it can be broadened only after another diagnostic proves a real firmware variant.

## Profile scope

The [`community-cronos-lineageos18.yaml`](https://github.com/maxlyth/ha-paneld/blob/main/docs/profiles/unofficial/community-cronos-lineageos18.yaml) profile selects only existing compiled Android mechanisms: ordinary brightness-based screen-off, Android ambient-light sensing and the reported Android-style `su` form. It declares no RGB LED, relay, radio, hardware-button, CPU-governor or density behaviour.

The root declaration records evidence from one image; it does not grant authority. After activation and restart, the running driver must probe the live route. A missing or blocked route remains unavailable and must not be treated as proof that another reflash is compatible.

## Limitations

- Unlocking, reflashing, recovery and maintaining the community LineageOS image are outside the ha-paneld project. No installation instructions or recovery images are supplied here.
- The profile does not describe the first-generation Echo Show 5 or any Echo Show 8 generation.
- The reported `/sys/class/leds/lcd-backlight` node is not evidence of a supported hardware backlight writer. Screen control remains on the ordinary Android brightness route.
- The reported minimum brightness of 10 matches ha-paneld's general never-blank floor and does not establish a hardware limit.

Use the [community catalogue procedure](/reference/profiles/community/) to import and validate the YAML. Review a fresh on-panel diagnostic report and confirm every expected capability after restart before relying on it unattended.
